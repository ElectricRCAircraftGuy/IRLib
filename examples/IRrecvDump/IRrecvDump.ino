/*
 * IRLib: IRrecvDump - dump details of IR codes with IRrecv ("IR Receiver" based on 50us timer interrupts)
 * An IR detector/demodulator must be connected to the input RECV_PIN.
 * 
 * -TO SAVE PROGRAM SPACE: If not using either dumpResults methods of IRdecode nor IRfrequency you can
 *  comment out the "#define USE_DUMP" line in IRLib.h, to save considerable program space.
 * -See IRLib.h for more details, options, & info. 
 *
 * Notes on Mark_Excess:
 * Try different values here for Mark_Excess. 50us is a good starting guess. Ken Shirriff originally used 100us. 
 * It is assumed that your IR receiver filters the modulated signal such that Marks (LOW periods
 * from the IR receiver) are several dozen microseconds too long and Spaces (HIGH periods from the
 * IR receiver) are the same amount too short. This is the case for most IR receivers.
 * If using the dirt-cheap (<$1 for 10) 1838 IR receivers from Ebay, however, 
 * I recommend setting Mark_Excess to -31us. If using the higher quality TSOP4838 ones, 
 * I recommend setting Mark_Excess to +45us. If Mark_Excess is off by too much, your IR receiver will 
 * appear not to work correctly at all, and will not properly decode IR signals.

/*
OPTIONAL: SINGLE VS DOUBLE-BUFFERING: Create another buffer to enable double-buffering for the IR 
receiver code. If double-buffered, your interrupts will continue to receive new data in the background 
even while you are decoding the last dataset in your main code. If you do *not* use double-buffering,
that is ok too, but you must call resume() after you are done using any decoder functions, such 
as decode() or dumpResults(), and ***any IR data that tries to come in while you are decoding/before
you call resume() will be lost.*** See the extensive notes on buffers in IRLibRData.h for more info.
Note: RAWBUF is defined in IRLib.h.

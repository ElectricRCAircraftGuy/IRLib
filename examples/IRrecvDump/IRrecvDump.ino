 * IRLib: IRrecvDump - dump details of IR codes with IRrecv ("IR Receiver" based on 50us timer interrupts)
 * An IR detector/demodulator must be connected to the input RECV_PIN.
 * 
 * -TO SAVE PROGRAM SPACE: If not using either dumpResults methods of IRdecode nor IRfrequency you can
 *  comment out the "#define USE_DUMP" line in IRLib.h, to save considerable program space.
 * -See IRLib.h for more details, options, & info. 
 *
 * Notes on Mark_Excess:
 * Try different values here for Mark_Excess. 50us is a good starting guess. Ken Shirriff originally used 100us. 
 * It is assumed that your IR receiver filters the modulated signal such that Marks (LOW periods
 * from the IR receiver) are several dozen microseconds too long and Spaces (HIGH periods from the
 * IR receiver) are the same amount too short. This is the case for most IR receivers.
 * If using the dirt-cheap (<$1 for 10) 1838 IR receivers from Ebay, however, 
 * I recommend setting Mark_Excess to -31us. If using the higher quality TSOP4838 ones, 
 * I recommend setting Mark_Excess to +45us. If Mark_Excess is off by too much, your IR receiver will 
 * appear not to work correctly at all, and will not properly decode IR signals.
